    "1. Perform a single step of the Crank-Nicolson method for this electron, calculating the vector $\\psi(t)$ of values of the wavefunction, given the initial wavefunction above and using $N = 1000$ spatial slices with $a = L/N$. Your program will have to perform the following steps. First, given the vector $\\psi(0)$ at $t = 0$, you will have to multiply by the matrix $\\bf{B}$ to get a vector $\\bf{v} = \\bf{B}\\psi$. Because of the tridiagonal form of $\\bf{B}$, this is fairly simple. The $i$th component of $\\bf{v}$ is given by\n",
    "$$ v_i = b_1\\psi_i + b_2(\\psi_{i+1} + \\psi_{i-1}).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "   You will also have to choose a value for the time-step $h$. A reasonable choice is $h = 10^{-18}$ s. *(30 pts.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Second you will have to solve the linear system ${\\bf Ax}= {\\bf v}$ for $\\bf{x}$, which gives you the new value of $\\psi$. You could do this using a standard linear equation solver like the function $\\tt solve$ in numpy's $\\tt linalg$. *(20 pts.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once you have the code in place to perform a single step of the calculation, extend your program to perform repeated steps and hence solve for $\\psi$ at a sequence of times a separation $h$ apart. Note that the matrix $\\bf A$ is independent of time, so it doesn't change from one step to another. You can set up the matrix just once and then keep on reusing it for every step. *(30 pts.)*\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make an animation of the solution by displaying the real part of the wavefunction at each time-step. You can use the function rate from the package visual to ensure a smooth frame-rate for your animation-- see Section 3.5 on page 117 of the Newman text.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Run your animation for a while and describe what you see. Write a few sentences explaining in physics terms what is going on in the system. *(20 pts.)*"

    "The repeated motion of the wave packet moving right, reflecting back to the left, and so on, is an example of quantum wave packet reflection and interference. This type of motion demonstrates the wave-particle duality of quantum systems, where the particle exhibits both wave-like propagation and confinement within the spatial domain. It also highlights the role of boundary conditions in shaping the system's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the wave packet moves, it eventually interacts with the boundaries of the spatial domain. Since I've enforced zero wavefunction values at the edges (boundary conditions), the wave packet reflects back. This bouncing behavior is characteristic of wave-like phenomena and results from interference of the wave with itself upon hitting the boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The width of the wave packet is significant because it determines the region where the particle is most likely to be found. A wider wave packet implies the particle's position is more uncertain, with a higher probability of being spread over a larger area. Conversely, a narrower wave packet indicates the particle’s position is more confined to a smaller region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the wave packet spreads out due to its composition of multiple momentum components, each traveling at a different velocity. These differences cause the components to separate, resulting in the wave packet expanding. This process is known as dispersion.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the wave packet encounters the boundaries at x = 0 and x = L, it reflects off them instead of passing through. This behavior ensures the boundary condition psi(0) = 0 and psi(L) = 0 is satisfied, meaning the particle cannot exist beyond these points.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the wave packet reflects, it interacts with itself, creating interference effects. While some parts of the wave packet are reflected, others continue moving toward the boundary. The reflected waves overlap with the incoming waves, producing interference patterns. These patterns result from the constructive and destructive interference between the two wave components."
